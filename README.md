The IGP Toolkit is a collection of scripts created to help out in the daily running and maintenace of Trackman Golf Simulators installed by Indoor Golf Partner.

While the repo is publicly available, issues may arise if run on systems not using the same specs or folder structure as the computers provided by IGP.
